Attack Mechanism:
Prior to execution, the folder name Trash1000 is programmatically renamed to .Trash1000. The prefixed dot marks the folder as hidden in most operating systems, simulating a system trash directory. This reduces the likelihood of drawing user attention and,
in some cases, may avoid triggering certain antivirus heuristics. Once the designated PDF within this hidden directory is opened, the payload executes,
capturing target data and transmitting it via a hidden channel to a remote Google Form endpoint.

Disclaimer:
This proof-of-concept is intended strictly for educational and authorized penetration testing purposes.
Unauthorized deployment of such techniques is illegal and unethical, and may lead to severe legal consequences.
All demonstrations were conducted in isolated, controlled environments with explicit consent.
